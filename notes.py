# Unescape HTML Entities
"""
** when you get data from a website through (API), you can find symbols within the data string referring to a character
for example --->
"&#039" --> "the apostrophe ' "

** when you deal with (HTML Character), each character has an entity name & an entity number --> it is some symbols
referring to this character

** to unescape these entities and convert then to the actual character ---> there is a tool(website) called
(free formatter/escape html) - just copy the escaped text and get the unescaped one
-- to do this with python ---> import the module (html) then use the method ( html.unescape(the text) )

# TYPE HINTS IN PYTHON --->
"""
** you can create a variable and declare its datatype without giving it a value, but the value must be from its datatype
** you can also specify the datatype of the output of a function, but the output must be from its datatype you declared
** it will halp you not to make error that if there is a type error the IDE will tell you while writing the code
